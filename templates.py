    NAME is beginning to design solutions through programming. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN is designing and constructing an application to PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.  
    This is a classic first-year-project, where THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN will need to store attributes for different PROJECT_NOUN in a 
    database, and then retrieve PROJECT_NOUN based on user input.   The Design cycle is composed of four interconnected parts; inquiry, planning, 
    construction and evaluation.  NAME has demonstrated excellent skill and understanding in the first two parts. We are still working on the second two parts. 
    THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN is learning and applying the PHP programming language 
    PROGRAMMING_SKILL. When asked what THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN wanted to learn, THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN replied “STUDENT_VOICE”. POSSESIVE_PRONOUN reply evidenced a desire to become
    more independent. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN will be given this opportunity in class during our second design project. 
    NAME can also independently work on projects and be comfortable "not knowing". NAME produces excellent-quality work. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN communicates basic understanding of 
    most concepts and contexts with few misunderstandings and minor gaps. NAME is CLASSROOM_BEHAVIOR. 
    NAME often demonstrates basic critical and creative thinking.  THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN uses knowledge and skills with some 
    flexibility in familiar classroom situations, but requires support in unfamiliar situations. NAME can 
    improve POSSESIVE_DETERMINER knowledge and understanding by asking for help more often, independently attempting difficult 
    coding projects and seeking ways to add complexity to POSSESIVE_DETERMINER projects. Designing solutions is incredibly 
    challenging and rewarding.  Designing solutions is incredibly challenging and rewarding. NAME should continue to push REFLEXIVE_PRONOUN to 
    to computationally solve problems by independently attempting to code, solve problem-sets, and think computationally.

    NAME is progressing through POSSESIVE_DETERMINER first year of IB Computer Science. NAME has learned the Python
    programming language PROGRAMMING_SKILL. 
    In addition to programming and computational thinking NAME has learned computer orginzation, networking and system fundamentals. NAME's
    progress thus far is PROGRESS. NAME displays broad knowledge of factual information in the syllabus. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN 
    demonstrates sound understanding of most concepts and principles and applies them in some contexts. 
    When asked what THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN wanted to learn, THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN replied “STUDENT_VOICE”. 
    POSSESIVE_PRONOUN reply evidenced a desire to become
    more independent.  NAME demonstrates personal skills, perseverance and
 responsibility in a variety of activities in a fairly consistent manner. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN communicates basic understanding of 
    most concepts and contexts with few misunderstandings and minor gaps. NAME is CLASSROOM_BEHAVIOR. 
    NAME often demonstrates basic critical and creative thinking.  THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN uses knowledge and skills with some 
    flexibility in familiar classroom situations, but requires support in unfamiliar situations. NAME can 
    improve POSSESIVE_DETERMINER knowledge and understanding by asking for help more often, independently attempting difficult 
    coding projects and seeking ways to add complexity to POSSESIVE_DETERMINER projects. IB DP Computer science asks for a 
 highly specific terminology and approach to solving problems. To develop even further in this class, NAME must better meet 
 these specific terminology and problem-solving requirements by more carefully using the correct terms to describe technical 
 systems.
  The internal assessment is an important part of his final grade and NAME should focus uninterrupted time on programming 
  during the summer.
