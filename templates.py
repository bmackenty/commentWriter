    NAME is beginning to design solutions through programming. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN is designing and constructing an application to PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.  
    This is a classic first-year-project, where THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN will need to store attributes for different PROJECT_NOUN in a 
    database, and then retrieve PROJECT_NOUN based on user input.   The Design cycle is composed of four interconnected parts; inquiry, planning, 
    construction and evaluation.  NAME has demonstrated excellent skill and understanding in the first two parts. We are still working on the second two parts. 
    THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN is learning and applying the PHP programming language 
    PROGRAMMING_SKILL. When asked what THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN wanted to learn, THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN replied “STUDENT_VOICE”. POSSESIVE_PRONOUN reply evidenced a desire to become
    more independent. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN will be given this opportunity in class during our second design project. 
    NAME can also independently work on projects and be comfortable "not knowing". NAME produces excellent-quality work. THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN communicates basic understanding of 
    most concepts and contexts with few misunderstandings and minor gaps. NAME is CLASSROOM_BEHAVIOR. 
    NAME often demonstrates basic critical and creative thinking.  THIRD_PERSON_SINGULAR_PRONOUN uses knowledge and skills with some 
    flexibility in familiar classroom situations, but requires support in unfamiliar situations. NAME can 
    improve POSSESIVE_DETERMINER knowledge and understanding by asking for help more often, independently attempting difficult 
    coding projects and seeking ways to add complexity to POSSESIVE_DETERMINER projects. Designing solutions is incredibly 
    challenging and rewarding.  Designing solutions is incredibly challenging and rewarding. NAME should continue to push THIRD_PERSON_PLURAL_GENDER 
    to computationally solve problems by independently attempting to code, solve problem-sets, and think computationally.
